Welcome to the **Antigravity Workspace Template**. This is a production-grade starter kit for building autonomous agents on the Google Antigravity platform, fully compliant with **Antigravity Official Documentation**—and proudly "Anti-LangChain" thanks to its minimal, transparent architecture.


## 🌟 Project Philosophy

In an era rich with AI IDEs, I wanted to achieve an enterprise-grade architecture with just **Clone -> Rename -> Prompt**.

This project leverages the IDE's context awareness (via `.cursorrules` and `.antigravity/rules.md`) to embed a complete **Cognitive Architecture** directly into the project files.

When you open this project, your IDE is no longer just an editor; it transforms into a **"Knowledgeable" Architect**.

### Why do we need a "Thinking" Scaffold?

When using Google Antigravity or Cursor for AI development, I found a pain point:

**IDEs and models are powerful, but "empty projects" are weak.**

Every time we start a new project, we repeat boring configurations:
- "Should my code go in src or app?"
- "How do I define tool functions so Gemini recognizes them?"
- "How do I make the AI remember context?"

This repetitive labor is a waste of creativity. My ideal workflow is: **Git Clone -> IDE already knows what to do.**

So I created this project: **Antigravity Workspace Template**.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: Artifact-First

This workspace enforces the **Artifact-First** protocol. The Agent does not just write code; it produces tangible outputs (Artifacts) for every complex task.

1. **Planning**: `artifacts/plan_[task_id].md` is created before coding.
2. **Evidence**: Logs and test outputs are saved to `artifacts/logs/`.
3. **Visuals**: UI changes generate screenshot artifacts.

## 🛸 How It Works

The agent follows a strict "Think-Act-Reflect" loop, simulating the cognitive process of Gemini 3.

    participant Artifacts as 📂 Artifacts

    User->>Agent: "Refactor Authentication"
    activate Agent
    
    Agent->>Artifacts: Create Implementation Plan
    
    Note over Agent: <thought> Deep Think Process </thought>
    Agent->>Agent: Formulate Strategy
    
    Agent->>Tools: Execute Tool (code_edit)
    activate Tools
    Tools-->>Agent: Result
    deactivate Tools
    
    Agent->>Artifacts: Save Logs/Evidence
    
    Agent-->>User: Final Report (Walkthrough)
    deactivate Agent
```

## 🔥 Killer Features

- 🧠 **Infinite Memory Engine**: Recursive summarization automatically compresses history. Context limits are a thing of the past.
- 🛠️ **Universal Tool Protocol**: Generic ReAct pattern. Just register any Python function in `available_tools`, and the Agent learns to use it.
- ⚡️ **Gemini Native**: Optimized for Gemini 2.0 Flash's speed and function calling capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
1. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Run the Agent**:
    ```bash
    python src/agent.py
    ```

### Docker Deployment
1. **Build & Run**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## 🚀 The "Zero-Config" Workflow

Stop writing long system prompts. This workspace pre-loads the AI's cognitive architecture for you.

### Step 1: Clone & Rename (The "Mold")
Treat this repository as a factory mold. Clone it, then rename the folder to your project name.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/study8677/antigravity-workspace-template.git my-agent-project
cd my-agent-project
# Now you are ready. No setup required.
```

### Step 2: The Magic Moment ⚡️
Open the folder in Cursor or Google Antigravity.
- 👀 **Watch**: The IDE automatically detects `.cursorrules`.
- 🧠 **Load**: The AI silently ingests the "Antigravity Expert" persona from `.antigravity/rules.md`.

### Step 3: Just Prompt (No Instructions Needed)
You don't need to tell the AI to "be careful" or "use the src folder". It's already brainwashed to be a Senior Engineer.

**Old Way (Manual Prompting)**:
> "Please write a snake game. Make sure to use modular code. Put files in src. Don't forget comments..."

**The Antigravity Way**:
> "Build a snake game."

The AI will automatically:
1. 🛑 **Pause**: "According to protocols, I must plan first."
2. 📄 **Document**: Generates `artifacts/plan_snake.md`.
3. 🔨 **Build**: Writes modular code into `src/game/` with full Google-style docstrings.

## 🔥 New: True Zero-Config Tool & Context Loading

**No more manual imports!** The agent now automatically discovers:

### 🛠️ Auto Tool Discovery
Drop any Python file into `src/tools/` and the agent instantly knows how to use it:

```python
# src/tools/my_custom_tool.py
def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> str:
    """Analyzes the sentiment of given text.
    
    Args:
        text: The text to analyze.
        
    Returns:
        Sentiment score and analysis.
    """
    # Your implementation
    return "Positive sentiment detected!"
```

**That's it!** No need to edit `agent.py`. Just restart and the tool is available.

### 📚 Auto Context Loading
Add knowledge files to `.context/` and they're automatically injected:

```bash
echo "# Project Rules\nUsefriendly language." > .context/project_rules.md
```

The agent will follow these rules immediately on next run.

## 🔥 New: Multi-Agent Swarm Protocol

**Collaborate at scale!** The swarm enables multiple specialist agents to work together:

### 🪐 Architecture: Router-Worker Pattern

    User[User Task] --> Router[🧭 Router Agent]
    Router --> Coder[💻 Coder Agent]

    Router --> Researcher[📚 Researcher Agent]
    Coder --> Router
    Reviewer --> Router
    Researcher --> Router
    Router --> Result[📊 Synthesized Result]
```

**Specialist Agents:**
- **Router**: Analyzes tasks, delegates to specialists, synthesizes results
- **Coder**: Writes clean, well-documented code
- **Reviewer**: Checks quality, security, best practices
- **Researcher**: Gathers information and insights

### 🚀 Usage

**Run the interactive demo:**
```bash
python -m src.swarm_demo
```

**Use in your code:**
```python
from src.swarm import SwarmOrchestrator

swarm = SwarmOrchestrator()
result = swarm.execute("Build a calculator and review it for security")
print(result)
```

**Example output:**
```

💻 [Coder] Creating calculator implementation...
